'''
A string is given. We have to find the longet substring which is unique(that has no repetation) and
has a minimum size of 3.
if more than one substring is found with max length the we have to print the one which appeared
first in the string.If no substring is present which matches the condition then we have to print ‐1.
eg ‐ input ‐ "A@bcd1abx"
output ‐ "A@bcd1"
Note:‐" A@bcd1a" is not a unique substring as it contains "A" and "a" and substring "bcd1a" does
not appear first.
